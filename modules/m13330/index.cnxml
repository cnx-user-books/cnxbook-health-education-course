			<para id="para_N68514"> Treatment: If your child's baby tooth has been knocked

				into place (reimplanted) because it may damage the permanent tooth that is
				forming. </para>
			<para id="para_N68517"> If your child's permanent tooth is knocked out, quick
				action is needed to give the tooth its best chance of successfully being
				reimplanted. Here are the steps needed: </para>
			<list id="list_N68519">
				<item> Look for the tooth and pick it up by its crown (the white part), not the
					root. </item>
				<item> Carefully rinse the tooth with water. Remember to put the stopper
					into the sink! Do not scrub the root or you may remove important tissue
					that will be needed for the tooth to reconnect to the bone and gums.
					</item>
				<item> If possible, place the tooth into its socket. If that is not possible,
					keep the tooth moist in a glass of milk or water. </item>
				<item> Transport your child and the tooth to your dentist immediately. Your
					dentist will reimplant the tooth and put on a splint to anchor it in
					place. Teeth have the best chance of reattaching if they are
					reimplanted within an hour of being knocked out. </item>
